Cipher
- try to create cipher
- create key
- set key value
- set key to cipher
- execute operation (encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify)
- verify results
- report results

Problem:
- how to setup key value (e.g., RSA, RSA_CRT...)
- when on-card key generation is supported, then 
- use static array with fixed values?
